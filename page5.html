       <h1>Badminton has a history of nearly 150 years.</h1>
    <h2> It was first played in Gloucestershire, England, in about 1863. the roots of the sport can be traced to ancient Greece, China, and India, and it is closely related to the old children's game battledore and shuttlecock.</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The badminton World Federation was formed in 1934. Their first world championships were held in 1977. It first apeared in the olympic games as a demonstration sport in 1972, and as an exhibition sport in 1988. Competitive Badminton is usually played indoors, as light winds can affect how the shuttle moves around in the air. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Although Badminton may seem like an old and hard sport, it is still widely popular today. Famous players have also helped to boost the popularity of the sport, and I encourage you to give it a go if you haven't already. <a href="page6.html" title="Book a Court" > Click Here</a> to find out how to book a court.</p>
