       <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>
       <p> Badminton is a internationally recognised racquet sport that is played using rackets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played wih larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and "doubles" (with two players per side).</p>
<br>

    <p>It can be played both indoors and outdoors, but it is more commonly played indoors, as the wind can affect how the shuttle flies in the air.</p>
    <p>Indoor Badminton is played on a Badminton court, like the one shown below. For more information on the Badminton Court, please see <a href="page3.html" title="Go to Understanding the Court" > Understanding the Court</a>.</p>

        <p>A Shuttlecock is a cork, to which feathers are attached to form a cone shape. A picture of some feather shuttlecocks on a court are shown below. </p>

    <br>
    <p>There are three types of shuttles in Badminton, Feather, Plastic and Hybird. In Professional Badminton matches or tournaments, feather shuttles are used, because they are easy to control and have the best flight. Unfortunately, Badminton Feather Shuttles are very expensive, and are very easy to break if not used with the correct Badminton Technique. At the Olympics, about two dozen shuttles are used in every match on average. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Plastic Shuttles are a great choice for use by beginners. They have a fast flight, because they are made from a nylon material, which usually results in a faster paced game. Plastic Shuttles have Fantastic Durability.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Hybird Shuttes are a combiniation of plastic and feather. and they are cheaper than most full feather shuttlecocks, and have more durability, but there are only very few currently available.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In badminton, you use rackets to hit the shuttlecocks over the net. There are generally three types of rackets, Head Heavy, Head Light, and Even Balance. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Head heavy badminton rackets are very popular for powerful players, as the racket is heavy in the head, which means it is more powerful for clears and smashes. It is more commonly used in singles. The drawback to a head heavy racket is that when the shuttle is close to the net, head heavy rackets will be at a disadvantage as it requires more power to lift the racket.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Head light Badminton Rackets are more suitable for doubles badminton, because they are more easy to manipulate and control. Head light Badminton Rackets excel in doubles Badminton, as they are the easiest to defend against opposing smashes, and better for fast paced games, especially at the net. The drawback for a head light Badminton racket is that it will be harder to clear or smash from the back of the court.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Even Balance rackets are a sort of middle ground between the above mentioned rackets. It suits both playing at the back of the court, and playing at the front of the court. </p>
