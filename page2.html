    <h3>The Basics</h3>
       <p>Badminton is the world's fastest racket sport. It can be played with two or four players. The objective of the game is to score points, by successfully hitting the shuttlecock over the net. </p>
    <br>
    <p> Badminton, like tennis, is a racket sport that is played by either two players or two teams of two players each (called singles and doubles, respectively). By hitting the shuttle successfully over the net and onto the ground, you will earn a point. You win by getting to 21 points first, and win by two in the process. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The first serve of a badminton game comes from the right half of the court to the court that is diagonally opposite. For the rest of the game, if you have an even number of points, serve from the right, if you have an odd number of points, then serve from the left. </p>
    <br>
    <p>In doubles, each team only has one "service." So, if one player on one team serves and faults, then the shuttle goes to a player on the other team, and so on.
When a receiving team wins a point and gets the serve, the team does not switch sides but serves from where they are standing. If they win the first service point, then the players switch positions from right to left.
After each game, opponents change ends of the court, and the side that won the previous game gets to serve at the start of the next game.</p>
